        <h4>A Doll's House ACT 1 - Henrik Ibsen</h4>

        <p><strong>NORA:</strong>Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed. [To the PORTER, taking out her purse.] How much?</p>
        <p><strong>PORTER:</strong>Sixpence</p>
        <p><strong>NORA:</strong>There is a shilling. No, keep the change. [The PORTER thanks her, and goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and listens.] Yes, he is in. [Still humming, she goes to the table on the right.]</p>
        <p><strong>HELMER:</strong>[calls out from his room]. Is that my little lark twittering out there?</p>
        <p><strong>NORA:</strong>Yes, it is!</p>
        <p><strong>HELMER:</strong>Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>
        <p><strong>NORA:</strong>Yes!</p>
        <p><strong>HELMER:</strong>When did my squirrel come home?</p>
        <P><strong>NORA:</strong>just now.Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</P>
        <p><strong>HELMER:</strong>Don’t disturb me,Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p>
